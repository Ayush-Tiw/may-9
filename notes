Primary key

1.index is something your topic and page number,and its purpose is to identify particular topic immediately (for fast acces)
index in table increases performance
index is mandatory in mySql table 
Any unique value can act as index in Mysql
If any column has primary key constraint then that column will act as index by default(we dont need not to add index manually)
Id column can act as a primary key.


Foreign key -->it will relate the mark table studentId to student table studentId
so if we try to add data in mark table with Id not in student table then it will throw error
here student is parent table and mark is child table

mysql is relational database so here we have relation between student table and mark table through studentId

foreign key can be repeated but primary key should not be repeated 



Joins(left,right ,inner)=>just joining the table 


Normalisation=>design database to reduces data redundancy,its a rule  to efficiently design your database
redundancy means duplicates or not of use

Data Redundancy: Reducing Duplicates in a table
Data Redundancy leads to certain problem

1.Insertion Anamoly:If new student with the same department then we have to repeat the department data again
2.Updation Anamoly: if HOD changes then all data has to be updated and if any data is missed it will lead to false data
3.Deletion data:If we delete student data then department data also been deleted along with it.


to design database we efficiently we have some Normalisation Normal forms:
1. 1NF
2. 2NF
3. 3NF
4. BCNF
5. 4NF
6. 5NF

1st Normal form:
Rules:
1. Atomic value:Each column must have only one value. It should not contain multiple values  by adding comas like AAA,BBB.
2. The data stored in a column must be in a same kind(integer with integer,string with string).
3. Each column should have a unique column name.
4. Order in which data saves doesn't matter.


 2nd Normal form:
Rules:
1. It sholud be in 1NF.
2.It should remove the partial dependencies.

               Student Table

2              physics     3months     mr.p

here comination of StudentID and subjectId is unique we cannot repeat there combination
here both StudentID and subjectId are prime  attribute in case of marksTable

Description:
From the markTable StudentId and SubjectId goes together as a primary key columns(prime Attribution).
If we want to retrieve mark then we need two attribute StudentID and subjectId.
but if want to retrieve teacherName only SubjetId is necessary but markTable have two prime attribute.
This is called partial Dependencies and it has to be removed.
Partial Dependencies:
whether a non-prime attribute  depends on only one prime-attribute it is said to be partial Dependency.

solution:
teacherName can be replaced in subjectTable and it should be removed from markTable.



3rd NormalForm: ReducingRules:
1. It should be in 2NF.
2. It should remove Transition Dependency.

ExamId(non-prime attribute) depend on SubjectId

4                theory                   80

for ExamTable ExamId is prime attribute
Transitive dependencies: 
If a non-prime attribute(examName) depends on another non-prime attribute it is said to be transitive dependency.

Description:
From the above table exam_name depends on student and subject such as each dept student will have different exams based on subjectName 
For each exam there is different total_marks changes based on exam.Therefore Total/marks depends on exam_name.

TotalMarks dependes on exam name but exam name is not a part of primary keys.This is said to be transitive dependencies and we can remove it by creating the new table for ExamName and TotalMarks
